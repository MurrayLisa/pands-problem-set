##Description

This project displays the solutions 1-10 for the Problem set 2019 issued as part of the Programming and Scripting module at Galway-Mayo Institue of Technology in semester 1 from a novice programmer.

The questions are as follows
1. Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number
2. Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T. 
3. Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12
4. Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and,if it is even,divide it by two,but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one. 
5. Write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime
6. Write a program that takes a user input string and outputs every second word. 
7. Write a program that takes a positive ﬂoating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. 
8. Write a program that outputs today’s date and time in the format “Monday,January 10th 2019 at 1:15pm”. 
9. Write a program that reads in a text ﬁle and outputs every second line. Theprogram should take the ﬁlename from an argument on the command line
10. Write a program that displays a plot of the functions x, x2 and 2x in the range
